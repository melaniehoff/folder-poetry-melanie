Horrible smell
August 25, 2018
Size: 8-Piece Pots and Pans set
Pans look sturdy and work fine. The problem is the smell. Every time we use them it smells like toxic burning plastic and the fumes fill the entire house. We’re getting rid of them because we’re concerned that it could cause health damage.
